# UTF-9-samplified Drum Computer  

This project is based on the [bleep drum](https://bleeplabs.com/product/the-bleep-drum/) design by Dr. Bleep.

In 2025, **Felix Wiegeand (wgdmodular)** picked it up and released this **utf-9-samplified drum machine clone** with nice upgrades that make it perfect for starters and pros.

We (Modulove) put these into the hands of **beginners at DIY synthesizer solder workshops in 2025**.

- Few dozens were built.
- Every single one worked :)
- All were **hand-soldered by beginners (even kids!)**.

It turned out to be a **perfect entry-level project**.

The new firmware adds **Additonal functionality, fixes, and performance tricks** that came out of those builds and feedback from users.
